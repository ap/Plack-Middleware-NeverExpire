=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware::NeverExpire - set expiration headers far in the future

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in app.psgi
 use Plack::Builder;
 
 builder {
     enable_if { $_[0]{'PATH_INFO'} =~ m!^/static/! } 'NeverExpire';
     $app;
 };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This middleware adds headers to a response that allow proxies and browsers to
cache them for an effectively unlimited time. It is meant to be used in
conjunction with the L<Conditional|Plack::Middleware::Conditional> middleware.

=head1 INTERFACE

This middleware provides some functions for general use. They are not exported.

=head2 C<imf_fixdate>

This takes an epoch time and returns it as a timestamp formatted according to
L<S<RFC 9110 section 5.6.7>|https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-date-time-formats>.

=head2 C<inject_headers>

This takes a L<PSGI> response array and adds the caching headers to it
if the status is 200.
It returns nothing.

=item *

L<Plack::Middleware::Expires>

For most requests you want either immediate expiry with conditional C<GET>,
or indefinite caching, or on high-load websites maybe a very short expiry
duration for certain URIs (on the order of minutes or seconds, just to keep
them from getting hammered): fine-grained control is rarely needed. I wanted
a really trivial middleware for when it's not, so I wrote NeverExpire.

But when you need it, L<Expires|Plack::Middleware::Expires> will give you the
precise control over expiry durations that NeverExpire doesn't.
